# pcmsolvermeta

Check into this repository the files you use to manage PCMSolver that aren't
suitable for distribution in the main repository, whether for reasons of
machine-specificity or rare use or otherwise. Also files that other developers
should be aware of so 'auto-procedures' can be traced.

* Nightly build scripts for the testboard
* The documentation update script
* The copyright notice update script
* The line-of-code histogram generator script

See README.md files in subdirectories for specific notes
